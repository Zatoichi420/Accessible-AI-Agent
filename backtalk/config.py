"""Configuration — backtalk.json in the repo root, merged over defaults.

backtalk deliberately owns NO personality. Your agent's identity lives in
the CLAUDE.md of whatever folder `agent_dir` points at — backtalk just
gives that agent a mouth and ears. The only voice-related instruction it
adds is the spoken-delivery discipline below, which is about the MEDIUM
(writing for the ear), never the character.

    # "sonnet": the SDK resolves aliases through its own bundled CLI and
    # can silently land on an older model. The fast tier is most of the

    "deep_model": "claude-opus-5",
    # Tool permissions for the voice session. "ask" is the default ON
    # PURPOSE (safety is opt-out, never opt-in): when the agent wants a
    # gated tool (write a file, run a real command), it ASKS OUT LOUD
    # and waits. Answer by voice or by typing. An EXACT yes approves
    # ("yes", "yeah", "go ahead", "approved"...); anything else denies,
    # and your words are passed back to the agent as the reason, so
    # "no, put it in drafts instead" actually steers it. No answer
    # within 75 seconds means no, out loud. Most read-only work passes
    # without asking; anything that changes things asks.
    # "bypassPermissions" is AUTO-APPROVE: the agent acts without
    # asking, exactly like a terminal session with approvals off.
    # (Not to be confused with hands-free LISTENING, which is about
    # the microphone: see mic_mode below.) Never hand-edit this file
